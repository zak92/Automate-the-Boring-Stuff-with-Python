# Flow Control

## Boolean Values
The Boolean data type has only two values: True and False. They always start with a capital T or F, with the rest of the word in lowercase. 
### Example
spam = True
print(spam)

**Output**: True

## Comparison Operators
Comparison operators, compare two values and evaluate down to a single Boolean value.

### Examples
1. 42 == 99   
**Output: False**
2. 2 != 2
**Output: False**
3. 'dog' != 'cat'
**Output: True**

## Boolean Operators
The three Boolean operators (and, or, and not) are used to compare Boolean values.

The and and or operators always take two Boolean values (or expressions)
* The and operator evaluates an expression to True if both Boolean values are True; otherwise, it evaluates to False. 
* The or operator evaluates an expression to True if either of the two Boolean values is True. If both are False, it evaluates to False.
* The not operator operates on only one Boolean value (or expression). The not operator simply evaluates to the opposite Boolean value.

## Examples
1. (4 < 5) and (5 < 6)
**Output: True**
2. (1 == 2) or (2 == 2)
**Output: True**
