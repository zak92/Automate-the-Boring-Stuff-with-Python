# Lists
## The List Data Type
A list is a value that contains multiple values in an ordered sequence. The term list value refers to the list itself not the values in the list. A list value looks like this: ['cat', 'bat', 'rat', 'elephant']. Values inside the list are also called items. Items are separated with commas (that is, they are comma-delimited).

## Getting Individual Values in a List with Indexes
Say you have the list ['cat', 'bat', 'rat', 'elephant'] stored in a variable named spam. The Python code spam[0] would evaluate to 'cat', and spam[1] would evaluate to 'bat', and so on.

Lists can also contain other list values. The values in these lists of lists can be accessed using multiple indexes, like so:

![lists in lists]()

## Negative Indexes
While indexes start at 0 and go up, you can also use negative integers for the index. The integer value -1 refers to the last index in a list, the value -2 refers to the second-to-last index in a list, and so on.

![negative index]()
