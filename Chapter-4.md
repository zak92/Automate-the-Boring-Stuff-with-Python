# Lists
## The List Data Type
A list is a value that contains multiple values in an ordered sequence. The term list value refers to the list itself not the values in the list. A list value looks like this: ['cat', 'bat', 'rat', 'elephant']. Values inside the list are also called items. Items are separated with commas (that is, they are comma-delimited).

## Getting Individual Values in a List with Indexes
Say you have the list ['cat', 'bat', 'rat', 'elephant'] stored in a variable named spam. The Python code spam[0] would evaluate to 'cat', and spam[1] would evaluate to 'bat', and so on.

Lists can also contain other list values. The values in these lists of lists can be accessed using multiple indexes, like so:

![lists in lists]()

## Negative Indexes
While indexes start at 0 and go up, you can also use negative integers for the index. The integer value -1 refers to the last index in a list, the value -2 refers to the second-to-last index in a list, and so on.

![negative index]()

## Getting a List from Another List with Slices
Just as an index can get a single value from a list, a slice can get several values from a list, in the form of a new list. A slice is typed between square brackets, like an index, but it has two integers separated by a colon. 
### Example
spam = ['cat', 'bat', 'rat', 'elephant']

spam[1:3] is a list with a slice 

Output: ['bat', 'rat']

In a slice, the first integer is the index where the slice starts. The second integer is the index where the slice ends. A slice goes up to, but will not include, the value at the second index.

As a shortcut, you can leave out one or both of the indexes on either side of the colon in the slice. Leaving out the first index is the same as using 0, or the beginning of the list. Leaving out the second index is the same as using the length of the list, which will slice to the end of the list.
### Example
spam[:2]

Output: ['cat', 'bat']

## Getting a Listâ€™s Length with the len() Function
The len() function will return the number of values that are in a list value passed to it, just like it can count the number of characters in a string value.
### Example
spam = ['cat', 'dog', 'moose']

len(spam)/
3

## Changing Values in a List with Indexes
You can also use an index of a list to change the value at that index.

### Example
spam = ['cat', 'bat', 'rat', 'elephant']
>>> spam[1] = 'aardvark'
>>> spam
['cat', 'aardvark', 'rat', 'elephant']
