# Automate-the-Boring-Stuff-with-Python

## Introduction

This repository contains chapter summaries of the book - "Automate the Boring Stuff with Python" by Al Sweigart. It also includes answers to selected exercises from each chapter. 

My intention is to learn basic python automation skills and thereafter build on my learning foundation by developing a wider array of more advanced python automation tools.
